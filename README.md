### Brief Bio
I am a **CS ed enthusiast** working to break the barrier to entry to computer science education for for college students. I am also a *Research Analyst* for the Educational Technology Department at New York University. While being an avid programmer, I am also a nerd with data and research in education. When I am not at work, I work on my thesis, and when I'm not busy with that, you can find me walking around NYC exploring cute cafes and writing.

Here's my core forte - *The Design Thinking Process*:
1. Empathize
* Understand the user's needs, challenges, and experiences.
* Conduct interviews, observations, and research to gather insights.
* Develop empathy to create user-centric solutions.
2. Define
* Synthesize the research findings to identify the core problem.
* Frame the problem statement in a way that is actionable and user-focused.
* Use techniques like "How Might We" (HMW) questions to refine the problem.
3. Ideate
* Brainstorm multiple creative solutions to the problem.
* Use techniques like mind mapping, sketching, and rapid prototyping.
* Encourage diverse ideas and avoid judgment during ideation.
4. Prototype
* Create low-fidelity or high-fidelity prototypes of selected ideas.
* Test the prototypes to explore different possibilities.
* Refine based on feedback and iterate quickly.
5. Test
* Gather user feedback by testing prototypes in real-world scenarios.
* Identify what works and what needs improvement.
* Iterate and refine the solution until it meets user needs effectively.
